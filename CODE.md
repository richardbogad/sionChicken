# The sionChicken Project

## Description
Dive into the internals of the revolutionary world of the sionChicken Project, featuring the first-ever virtual breedable 3D lifeforms within SecondLife. \
Crafted by the visionary Richard Bogad during 2008-2009, this project has set a new standard in virtual ecosystems, \
achieving massive success and even earning a nomination for the prestigious Linden Prize in 2010. \
This repository contains the latest v12 version of the lifeforms.

General information about the project can be found [here](README.md).

Please NOTE: Additional tools like the 'transport box', 'proteggtor', 'healing kit', 'radi-O-static' or the growing 'sionCorn' plants are not yet available in this repository. \
Furthermore, status display objects for the chicken and eggs are also not yet added to this repository.
The LSL scripting language was very limited, therefore object oriented design and proper unit testing was not possible.

## Setup of Primitives

Use the 'Data To Object' script to setup the primitive object appearances.

The script can be found here:
https://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Object_to_Data_v1.4#Data_To_Object_.28Script.29

Follow the 'Data To Object' manual to create following objects:
* data-to-object/objdef-sionChicken.txt
* data-to-object/objdef-sionChicken egg.txt
* data-to-object/objdef-sionChicken food.txt

## Setup of Scripts & Objects

In the scripts, search for the avatar key '140c69e0-beca-4dfc-b705-56efadd3be21' and change this key to your personal avatar key. \
This is necessary, because initializing scripts by owners was not allowed to fight object cloning. 

Once the objects above have been created, place the following content into their main & sub-prims:

* Object Base-Prim name 'sionChicken':
    * Script: sionChicken.Animation
    * Script: sionChicken.Brain
    * Script: sionChicken.Movation
    * Script: sionLabs.Communication
    * Script: sionLabs.Slave

    * Linked Sub-Prim name 'kopf':
        * Script: sionLabs.Slave
        * Script: sionChicken.Name

    * Linked Sub-Prim name 'schnabel':
        * Script: sionLabs.Slave

    * Linked Sub-Prim name 'rumpf':
        * Script: sionLabs.Slave

    * Linked Sub-Prim name 'fluegelL':
        * Script: sionLabs.Slave
        * Script: sionChicken.AnimFluegelL

    * Linked Sub-Prim name 'fluegelR':
        * Script: sionLabs.Slave
        * Script: sionChicken.AnimFluegelR

    * Linked Sub-Prim name 'haxiL':
        * Script: sionLabs.Slave
        * Script: sionChicken.AnimHaxiL

    * Linked Sub-Prim name 'haxiR':
        * Script: sionLabs.Slave
        * Script: sionChicken.AnimHaxiR

    * Linked Sub-Prim name 'schwanz':
        * Script: sionLabs.Slave

* Object 'sionChicken egg':
    * Script: sionChicken.Egg
    * Script: sionLabs.Communication
    * Visual Object: 'breakpart one'
    * Visual Object: 'breakpart two'
    * Visual Object: 'broken egg'

* Object 'sionChicken food':
    * Script: sionChicken.Food
    * Script: sionLabs.Communication
