# sionChicken Play Guide

These amazing creatures are very close to their real life counter-parts and quickly become a major part of your Second Life world. Like all pets, you will form an emotional attachment to them and when their time comes to go to the Great Chicken Coop in the sky, it will affect you.

They are designed to have a mortality rate and will die. The length of time they live will depend on many variables such as sim performance, care, handling, feeding patterns, sickness, other chickens, etc ... With ideal conditions and care, these chickens can live for up to one year, providing they don't become ill or are killed by griefers.

For as long as you have your chickens, you will also have to purchase food for them. Currently food comes in packs of 4 bowls with 150 servings in each bowl. Chickens will eat one bowl of food each per week regardless of their size or age.

Before you decide whether or not to raise your very own "NEW WAVE" sionChickens, let's look at just what these wonderful creatures can and can't do and how they are designed to bring you months of enjoyment unlike any other pet currently available.

You are able to watch them grow up within weeks, made possible by the new seamlessGrow™ technology. Simply rezz your "NEW WAVE" eggs and watch as they hatch and come to life. Each egg has a fifty percent chance of being a rooster or a hen. The gender will be picked by the integrated genderRandomize™ mechanism.

Eggs purchased from Sion Corp take about 15 minutes to hatch and come in the basic starter colours. All other colours must be purchased from reputable resellers who carry the "NEW WAVE" line of products and take about 2 hours to hatch.

Please note that hatch times may vary and can be slightly longer or shorter to reach 100%.

As your pets grow into puberty, they will be ready to mate. If you happen to be the lucky owner of a grown up hen and a rooster, you will most likely find laid eggs on your land after a while. With infiRepro™ you can now watch the next generation hatch, or you may want give those eggs away as a gift to a friend or sell them. It’s possible to do so once they are placed in a sionEgg box sold separately.

WARNING!! Originals and New Wave chickens can not be mated with each other. "New Wave" chickens can only mate with other "New Wave" chickens. "Original" chickens can only be mated with other "Original" chickens. If you are not sure what race of chickens you currently have, please ask for assistance in the in world support groups.

Sion Corp is proud to present another new breakthrough: pathfindAlgorithm™ - which makes it easy for your pet to walk around obstacles like boxes, or avatars.
In combination with saneSense™, your chickens avoid neighbouring parcels, water, or slopes but will play with toys and interact with their owners.

These chickens and eggs are completely physical and they can be coddled or pushed around. They can even be killed by weapons. So take care of them ! Do not bump or step on them, as they will remember you and it will take them a long time to trust you again !

Also, avoid putting any unboxed chickens or unboxed eggs into your inventory, they will get crushed and die.
